			<p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. 
				The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros,
				Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.[2] The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world. Coffee plants are now
				cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly 
				grown are arabica and robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked,
				processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.
				Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.
            </p>
			<p>
				Coffee is slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content. Coffee is one of the most popular
				drinks in the world.[3] It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, café latte, etc.). 
				It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative. Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption 
				is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption lowers the risk of some diseases, 
				although there is generally poor quality of such studies.

		<div id="process">
			<h4>processing</h4>
			<p>Coffee berries and their seeds undergo several processes before they become the familiar roasted coffee. 
			Berries have been traditionally selectively picked by hand; a labor-intensive method, it involves the selection of only the berries 
			at the peak of ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness 
			by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two methods—the dry process method, simpler and less labor-intensive 
			as the berries can be strip picked, and the wet process method, which incorporates fermentation into the process and yields a mild coffee.[81]

			Then they are sorted by ripeness and color and most often the flesh of the berry is removed, usually by machine, and the seeds are 
			fermented to remove the slimy layer of mucilage still present on the seed. When the fermentation is finished, the seeds are washed 
			with large quantities of fresh water to remove the fermentation residue, 
			which generates massive amounts of coffee wastewater. Finally, the seeds are dried.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="roast">
			<h4>roasting</h4>
			<p>The next step in the process is the roasting of the green coffee. Coffee is usually sold in
			a roasted state, and with rare exceptions all coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by
			the supplier, or it can be home roasted.[86] 
			The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the 
			coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume,
			causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.

			The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches approximately 200 °C (392 °F), though different varieties of
			seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates.[87] During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks
			down starches, changing them to simple sugars that begin to brown, which alters the color of the bean.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="grate">
			<h4>grating roasted beans</h4>
			<p>Depending on the color of the roasted beans as perceived by the human eye, they will be labeled as light, 
			medium light, medium, medium dark, dark, or very dark. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring 
			the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with a light source in the near-infrared spectrum. This elaborate light meter
			uses a process known as 
			spectroscopy to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted coffee's relative degree of roast or flavor development.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="decaf">
			<h4>decaffeination</h4>
			<p>
				Decaffeination may also be part of the processing that coffee seeds undergo. Seeds are decaffeinated when they are still green. 
				Many methods can remove caffeine from coffee, but all involve either soaking the green seeds in hot water (often called the 
				"Swiss water process")[92] or steaming them, then using a solvent to dissolve caffeine-containing oils.[25] Decaffeination is 
				often done by processing 
				companies, and the extracted caffeine is usually sold to the pharmaceutical industry
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="store">
			<h4>storage</h4>
			<p>Coffee is best stored in an airtight container made of ceramic, glass, or non-reactive metal.
				Higher quality prepackaged coffee usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the 
				coffee to release gases.[94] Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved when it is stored away from moisture, heat, and light.
				The ability of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells.[93] Storage of coffee in
				the refrigerator is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration.[93] Exterior walls of buildings
				which face the sun may heat the interior of a home,
				and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall.[93] Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.
